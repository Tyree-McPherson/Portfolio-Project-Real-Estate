# Portfolio-Project-Real-Estate

I made this project using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery for the front-end and
Node.js (express), and MongoDB (mongoose) for the back-end. This website is to simulate the user
visiting a real estate website with listings and filters to find the best results for that user.
There are also agents for every listing as there would be for any other real estate website.

For the sake of this project, all information will be fake, made up, and some information may
be unrelated to one another (the same listing) like an image gallery. Anything that resembles "real"
information from a real world location is completely coincidental.
